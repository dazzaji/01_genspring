Welcome to the Initial Project Plan Structure Generator!
This module will create the basic structure for your project plan.

Received Project Goal: I need to deploy my flask app to a simple server so others can see it on the web.  I need a short plan for this.

  "Success_Measures": [
    "Flask application is accessible via a public URL.",
    "Application functions correctly on the server.",
    "Deployment process completed within allocated time and budget."
