  "Title": "Project: Adulthood 2.0 - Building a Fulfilling Life",
  "Overall_Summary": "This project aims to establish a fulfilling adult life across key areas: romantic partnership, professional success (leveraging the GenSpring project), community engagement, and physical well-being.",
  "Original_Goal": "I need to get my life focused on the next stage of adulthood, characterized by a stable romantic partner, a strong professional role, and active involvement in community or civic life and regular physical activities.  One approach to evolving into a new strong professional role will be the launch of my LLM-based agents project that allows for unbounded self-generated ideation, effective best-idea selection, cycles of plan formation and refinements, and in some cases even building and deploying some of the best plans.  It is called \"GenSpring\" because it is a perpetual wellspring of autonomously generated new value.  This could help with professional roles.",
